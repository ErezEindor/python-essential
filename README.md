# python-essential

**python-essential** is a fun bootcamp created to introduce and teach foundational Python skills using Jupyter Notebooks. This bootcamp is designed for beginners who want hands-on practice with Python basics and essential programming concepts.

## Inspiration

This bootcamp is inspired by the excellent Python courses and materials created by:
- [Jose Portilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmportilla/) & [Pierian Training](https://pieriantraining.com/) – Python Bootcamp
- [Ryan Mitchell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/remitchell/) – Python tutorials and educational content

## Topics Covered

- Python syntax and variables
- Data types and operations
- Control flow (if statements, loops, useful operators)
- Functions and their applications:
  - Basic function syntax and default parameters
  - Logic with functions & parity exercises
  - Tuple unpacking in functions
  - Function return values and multiple returns
- Data Structures and Operations:
  - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
  - List and dictionary comprehensions
  - Advanced tuple operations and unpacking
- Basic file I/O operations
- Practice challenges & mini-tests throughout
- Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Run the Notebooks

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**
   - Click on the green "Code" button on the repo homepage and choose "Download ZIP", or use:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ErezEindor/python-essential.git
     ```
2. **Install Python and Jupyter Notebook**
   - If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - Install Jupyter using pip:
     ```
     pip install notebook
     ```
3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   - Navigate to the downloaded repository folder in your terminal.
   - Run:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser.

4. **Open and Run Notebooks**
   - Click on any notebook (`.ipynb` file) to begin learning and practicing Python.

## Repository Structure

The project is organised by *chapter* folders that mirror a typical beginner-to-intermediate Python curriculum. Each folder contains one or more Jupyter notebooks with hands-on exercises and examples.

| Directory | Highlights |
|-----------|------------|
| **chapter 1_Getting started with python** | Jupyter basics, first *Hello World*, the Zen of Python |
| **chapter 2_quickstart** | Variables, data structures, operators, control-flow primer, factorial challenge, basic OOP |
| **chapter 3_Basic_Data_type** | Numbers, booleans, strings & bytes, hexadecimal and string challenges |
| **chapter 4_Basic Data Structures** | Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, comprehensions, ASCII-art encoding challenge |
| **chapter 5_Control Flow_And_Statements** | Advanced control flow: `if/elif/else`, `for` & `while` loops, useful operators, workflow mini-test |
| **chapter 6_methods_and_functions** | Complete function guide: syntax, arguments, logic, tuple unpacking, practical exercises |
| **workiing with files** | Basic file I/O operations with practical examples |
| **assessment_test for section1** | Comprehensive self-assessment on objects & data structures |

### Latest Additions

The repository now includes enhanced content in Chapter 6, featuring:
- Detailed function basics with step-by-step examples
- Logic implementation in functions
- Tuple unpacking in functions with practical examples
- Graded exercises from basic to advanced levels
- Real-world application scenarios

> **Learning Path Tip:** Each notebook builds on previous ones; follow them sequentially for the smoothest learning curve. Complete the exercises in each notebook before moving to the next one.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! If you spot an error or want to add new practice material:
1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-improvement`  
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add new exercise on dictionaries"`  
3. Push to the branch and open a pull request.

Please keep notebook cells clear (restart & run-all before committing) so outputs are reproducible.
