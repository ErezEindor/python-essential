# python-essential

**python-essential** is a fun bootcamp created to introduce and teach foundational Python skills using Jupyter Notebooks. This bootcamp is designed for beginners who want hands-on practice with Python basics and essential programming concepts.

## Inspiration

This bootcamp is inspired by the excellent Python courses and materials created by:
- [Jose Portilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmportilla/) & [Pierian Training](https://pieriantraining.com/) – Python Bootcamp
- [Ryan Mitchell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/remitchell/) – Python tutorials and educational content

## Topics Covered

- Python syntax and variables
- Data types and operations
- Control flow (if statements, loops, useful operators)
- Functions, default parameters & basic OOP
- Logic with functions & parity exercises
- Working with lists, dictionaries, sets **and comprehensions**
- Basic file I/O
- Practice challenges & mini-tests sprinkled throughout
- Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Run the Notebooks

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**
   - Click on the green "Code" button on the repo homepage and choose "Download ZIP", or use:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ErezEindor/python-essential.git
     ```
2. **Install Python and Jupyter Notebook**
   - If you don’t have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - Install Jupyter using pip:
     ```
     pip install notebook
     ```
3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   - Navigate to the downloaded repository folder in your terminal.
   - Run:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser.

4. **Open and Run Notebooks**
   - Click on any notebook (`.ipynb` file) to begin learning and practicing Python.

## Downloading Individual Notebooks

- To download a specific notebook, click on the filename in GitHub and then click the "Download" button or use "Raw" to save it.

## Repository Structure
The project is organised by *chapter* folders that mirror a typical beginner-to-intermediate Python curriculum. Each folder contains one or more Jupyter notebooks (and occasional helper files).

| Directory | Highlights |
|-----------|------------|
| **chapter 1_Getting started with python** | Jupyter basics, first *Hello World*, the Zen of Python. |
| **chapter 2_quickstart** | Variables, built-in data structures, operators, control-flow primer, factorial challenge, basic OOP. |
| **chapter 3_Basic_Data_type** | Numbers, booleans, strings & bytes, hexadecimal and string challenges. |
| **chapter 4_Basic Data Structures** | Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, list/dict comprehensions, ASCII-art encoding challenge. |
| **chapter 5_Control Flow_And_Statements** | `if/elif/else`, `for` & `while`, useful operators, workflow mini-test, advanced list comprehensions. |
| **chapter 6_methods_and_functions** | Function syntax, default arguments, logic with functions, graded code exercises. |
| **workiing with files/** | Basic file-I/O examples (read/write text files). |
| **assessment_test for section1/** | Self-assessment notebook on objects & data structures. |

> **Tip:** Each notebook builds on previous ones; open them sequentially for the smoothest learning curve.
